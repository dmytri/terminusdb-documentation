# Synchronizing Changes

{: .no_toc }

Sharing databases and updates to databases is easy with TerminusDB and TerminusHub. We call this pulling and pushing changes: you pull updates from TerminusHub to your local version and push changes from your local version to TerminusHub. This makes collaboration and synchronization easy.

## Pull

You can pull changes which were made on hub by selecting `pull`.

First, enter a database. 
Go to the synchronize tab on your database.

Press the `pull `button and you can pull the data from the remote database

## Push

Push is similar. Once you have made your changes, push the changes to the remote so others can access the latest version of the database. 

Press the `Push` button on the synchronize page.

You will see a success notification once you have pushed to the remote.
