# How To Guide

How To Guides are problem driven and are designed to be a source of quick information in 'doing mode' when working with TerminusDB and Hub. 

The idea is to provide a series of steps with a focus on the goal (getting something done!). They should address a particular problem and have no unnecessary explanation. Practical usability and not completeness is key. How Tos will not give you everything, they are like a recipe that you can alter according to your need or taste.

We are always trying to improve our docs. If you have any suggestions, let us know. And feel free to contribute.
