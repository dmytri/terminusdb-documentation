# Manage Collaborators

{: .no_toc }

Collaboration is at the heart of TerminusDB and TerminusHub. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to add and manage collaborators.

## Section 1 - Add and Manage Collaborators



In the TerminusDB console, you can add collaborators in the 'Collaborate' tab. You can choose the database to share, the associated permissions and the collaborator's ID or email address. If you want to add multiple collaborators, please seperate with a comma.

To manage collaborators and permissions, just click on the collaborate tab and you will see a list with associated permissions.

## Section 2 - Manage Private Collaborators 

If you have signed up for a pro-tier account on TerminusHub, you manage your private collaborators in the same way as above.
