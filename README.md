## What is TerminusDB and what does it do?

TerminusDB is an open-source general purpose graph database that stores data like Git. It is built for data people and allows fierce data integration, versioning out of the box and unparalleled query. No data platform is more productive.

TerminusDB allows for the whole suite of revision control features: branch, merge, squash, rollback, blame, and time-travel.

## What is TerminusHub and how does it work?

TerminusDBs are linked through TerminusHub. The hub allows the user to manage access to databases and to collaboratively work on shared resources. You can make changes to a database, push them to hub and have a collaborator pull the synced version of the database.

You can share and collaborate on curated data sets in a distributed manner using git-like operations (push, pull, fetch, clone, fork)

Collaboration is easy with clone/fork allowing data to be moved to your cloud or servers

Merge and branch operations let you mix and match data sources significantly simplifying integration tasks.
